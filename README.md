# Js-Password-Generator.github.io

This website is created for a coding bootcamp project at UT-Austin.

The website utilizes HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT to generate a random password based on user-selected criteria.

It prompts the user to choose password with a criteria based on the length and character type.

After the inputs pass the validation, the app will present to the user a password matching his/her prompted answer.

At the end the user will have the option to copy the generated password to a clipboard.
